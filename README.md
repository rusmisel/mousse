# mousse
vim for your mouse.

## installation
[`mousse-git` on the aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mousse-git) (thanks to @mhegreberg)

to install from source: `make install` (installs to `~/.local/bin` by default)

depends on `wayland-protocols`, `wlr-protocols`, `clang`, `wayland-scanner` to build, and `libwayland-client.so` at runtime
